# Hazel!

#### Deployment framework/app

Hazel aim's at helping you implement __Continuous Integration__ and __Continuous
Delivery__ by provinding you with an app that will keep track of your apps,
environments, versions, builds and commands. It has a nice web UI so that anybody
can trigger a deploy of the latest commit on master or a specific branch.

It is similar in functionality to [Deployinator](https://github.com/etsy/deployinator)
by Etsy or [Dreadnot](https://github.com/racker/dreadnot) by Rackspace but adds
a little more flexibility to fit in more use cases.

## Getting started

```bash
go run *.go
make build
```
